Challange (RoR):

Residents of Chicago can request graffiti removal through 311. Your task is to build a tool for reporting on graffiti removal requests by ward and month. Your tool should interact with the City of Chicago’s data API to retrieve the information needed.
Requirements
Your tool should take the following inputs:
·       the last name of an alderman
·       a month and year on which to report
Your report should return the following information:
·       the full name of the alderman
·       the ward number
·       the month and year covered by the report
·       the total number of graffiti removal requests for the ward for the month
Your tool should provide either a command-line interface or a JSON web service for receiving user input and providing the report. Do not use static data files to build the report. Your tool should interact with the city of Chicago’s data API.

·       example surface types: brick, stucco
·       the ability to compare the number of graffiti removal requests for two different months for the same ward
·       the ability to compare the number of graffiti removal requests for two different wards in the same month
·       the ability to report on how promptly, on average, the city responded to graffiti removal requests during a given month
·       a UI to run in a browser
